### Creating a Tutorial in Markdown


To create your tutorial in Markdown format, you can use [this example post](https://github.com/data-brain-mind/tutorials/blob/main/_posts/2025-04-28-distill-example.md) as a template. You can view the rendered version of the same post on our website [here]({% post_url 2025-04-28-distill-example %}).


Read our [sample blog post]({% post_url 2025-04-28-distill-example %}) carefully to see how you can add image assets, and how to write using $$\LaTeX$$!


**Important: make sure your tutorial is completely anonymized before you export and submit it!**

### Submission Instructions
---

**Submission should be completed through the [OpenReview submission form](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2025/Workshop/DBM/Tutorials&referrer=%5BHomepage%5D(%2F)#tab-your-consoles).**

To submit your tutorial, please follow these steps:

- **Markdown Content**: Enter your tutorial content into the **Markdown box** provided in the OpenReview submission form.
- **Figures**: Upload any images or figures used in your Markdown so they display correctly.
- **Code Links**: Include links to any relevant code (e.g., Jupyter notebooks or GitHub repositories). Be sure these links point to **anonymized** resources if required. These resources should demonstrate the core content of your tutorial.


You can preview how your tutorial will appear using the **Preview** tab in the OpenReview submission interface.


If you prefer to prepare your tutorial in a **Jupyter Notebook**, you may instead submit:

- A short overview of your tutorial in a `.md` (Markdown) file.
- A link to the corresponding `.ipynb` (notebook) file.

The Markdown file will be rendered and displayed on the blog page, along with a reference to your notebook.

Upon submission, we will review and render accepted tutorials on our [Tutorial Track blog page](/tutorials/blog/index.html).

Our template is based on the [ICLR Blogposts 2025](https://iclr-blogposts.github.io/2025/about/) project.  
You can browse additional examples in their GitHub repository:
