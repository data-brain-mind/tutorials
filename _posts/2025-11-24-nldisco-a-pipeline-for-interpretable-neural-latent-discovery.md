This tutorial introduces **NLDisco** (**N**eural **L**atent **Disco**very pipeline), a machine learning approach for discovering interpretable features in high-dimensional neural recordings. The method leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify meaningful latent dimensions that correspond to specific behavioural or environmental variables.

**What youâ€™ll accomplish:**
- Train sparse autoencoders on neural spike data to automatically discover interpretable features
- Use Matryoshka architecture to capture both broad and specific neural patterns simultaneously
- Validate discoveries through an interactive dashboard that visualizes feature-behavior relationships
